### THE FIRST TEAM PROJECT ON MACHINE LEARNING!

## 
This was the first ML project that I had the opportunity to do in a team. Since it was the very first team project, it took more time than we were given. But thanks to this project, I felt what it means to work in a team, met wonderful people in the team, because every person we meet, we meet for a reason, also, learned how to write code on my own, studied in detail how to visualize data, preprocess it, and also tried to use different machine learning algorithms, compared their performance and, in my opinion, made good progress in my knowledge in ML.

### THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT

- We have to analyze the housing market and evaluate the factors that affect pricing.  We have received information on real estate sales from 2006 to 2010, as well as a large number of independent variables that we have to study.

### TEAMWORK
- We used MIRO (Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration) and JIRA (Atlassian Software) for more efficient and well-coordinated teamwork.

### LIBRARIES
We used out of the most popular Python packages in Data Science and ML as: 
- NumPy, 
- Pandas, 
- Matplotlib
- Feature-engine 
- SciPy and 
- Scikit-learn 

### FINDINGS
- We found that we have to solve the problem with missing data, cardinality of categorical variables, with variables dominated by one label, with multicollinearity.
- We tried to select the parameters for replacing empty values, encoding, as well as the hyperparameters of the model through the GridSearchCV algorithm.
- We derived the performance results of the models for several metrics and compared them.
- And also came to the conclusion, when our models do a good job of predicting home prices, what factors most influence pricing.
- And most importantly, we worked as a team!
